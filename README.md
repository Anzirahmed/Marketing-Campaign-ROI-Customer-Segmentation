# Marketing-Campaign-ROI-Customer-Segmentation
Project Summary
This project analyzes marketing campaign performance to identify high-return customer segments and improve marketing spend efficiency.
The dataset includes demographic, behavioral, and transactional information from an e-commerce platform.
Through segmentation, correlation analysis, and ROI evaluation, the project measures marketing effectiveness and supports data-driven decision-making.
A one-page Power BI dashboard summarizes the insights for executives to monitor campaign efficiency, customer behavior, and profitability.
Objective: Determine which customer segments yield the highest return on marketing investment and how campaigns can be optimized to increase overall profitability.
The specific goals were:
Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) of marketing campaigns.
Identify customer segments with strong responsiveness and purchasing potential.
Assess the effectiveness of marketing channels (web, catalog, and store).
Recommend strategic actions to enhance targeting and retention.
Key Insights
1. Customer Segmentation and Profitability
Customers were clustered into four segments based on income, spending behavior, and recency.
Segment 3 represented the premium segment, showing approximately 40% higher spending and 15% higher campaign response rates than other segments.
Segment 1, the budget segment, had the largest customer base but the lowest ROI, indicating reduced effectiveness of repeated campaigns among low-value customers.
2. Channel Performance
Web campaigns generated the highest conversion rate (around 45%), indicating a strong digital engagement preference.
Catalog campaigns performed moderately well among older, higher-income customers.
Store campaigns underperformed both in reach and return, highlighting declining offline engagement.
3. Income and Spending Relationship
A strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.68) was observed between income and total spending, showing that higher-income customers are more responsive to premium campaigns.
Moderate-income customers responded well to targeted promotions and discounts.
4. Recency and Retention
Customers inactive for more than 100 days were approximately 70% less likely to respond to new campaigns.
Personalized reactivation strategies could improve engagement by 20–25%.
Maintaining communication with active customers every 45–60 days maximized retention and lifetime value.
5. Campaign ROI Analysis
The overall marketing ROI across campaigns was 1.28x, indicating that every dollar spent generated $1.28 in return.
Reallocating 15% of marketing spend from low-performing to high-performing segments could raise ROI to 1.45x.
Campaign frequency analysis revealed diminishing returns after three engagements per quarter.
